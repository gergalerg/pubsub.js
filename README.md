This is a working example on Nodev4.4.4 from the book

Node.js In Action.  Listing 3.11

The pubsub.js in the example from the book doesn't work as is.

I suspect it worked on earlier versions of Node but not v4 and up.

I added some ES6 Features like the class extends syntax for an 

eventEmitter instead of the one in the book. You can change that.
